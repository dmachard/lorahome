# LoRa Home Gateway

An end-to-end telemetry system featuring a modular **ESP32-C6 Web Gateway** and configurable **ESP32-C3 Sensor Client Nodes** transmitting encrypted data using **LoRa (433 MHz)** and **AES-128 GCM** security. 

The gateway exports **Prometheus metrics** (`/metrics`) for Grafana visualization and hosts a local configuration and diagnostic dashboard. Both devices store credentials and configuration parameters dynamically inside their **Non-Volatile Memory (NVM)** and support **Web Bluetooth (BLE) provisioning** directly from the local dashboard.

This project is designed to occupy the sweet spot between simple "proof-of-concept" LoRa examples and heavy-duty industrial LoRaWAN deployments:

* **Beyond Basic DIY:** Standard DIY LoRa projects are often insecure (transmitting data in clear text), hardcode credentials into the firmware, lack runtime management interfaces, and omit telemetry monitoring.
* **Lighter than LoRaWAN:** Full LoRaWAN infrastructures (using gateways and network servers like TTN or ChirpStack) offer professional routing and multi-channel collision avoidance, but they introduce steep setup overhead and require costly multi-channel gateway hardware.
* **Home Automation Tailored:** Uses a single-channel SX1262 gateway and a shared network AES-128 GCM key for effortless home deployment without managing complex multi-channel hardware or per-node key registries.

## Prerequisites & Installation

### 1. Install `arduino-cli` Globally
To compile and flash the boards, install `arduino-cli` in your user-level binary directory (`~/.local/bin`):
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arduino/arduino-cli/master/install.sh | BINDIR=~/.local/bin sh
```
Ensure that `~/.local/bin` is in your system `PATH`.

### 2. Install Cores & Required Libraries
Run the following commands to install the ESP32 platform core and all library dependencies for both the gateway and the nodes:
```bash
# Update index and install ESP32 platform
arduino-cli core update-index
arduino-cli core install esp32:esp32

# Install all required libraries
arduino-cli lib install "RadioLib" "Crypto" "Adafruit SSD1306" "Adafruit GFX Library" "Adafruit AHTX0" "Adafruit BusIO" "Adafruit Unified Sensor" "NimBLE-Arduino" "ArduinoJson" "NimBLE-DataPipe"
```

## Quick Start (Build & Flash)

### Flash the Gateway
```bash
cd lora-gw
make         # Generates web headers and compiles
make upload  # Flash the firmware via USB (Default port /dev/ttyACM0)
```

### Flash the Node
```bash
cd lora-node
make         # Compile node sketch
make upload  # Flash the node via USB (Default port /dev/ttyACM0)
```
